# Research Project: Evaluating Deep Learning Loss Functions with RAFT

This project is a fork of the original RAFT implementation by Teed & Deng (2020) to investigate different loss functions for optical flow estimation.

## Original Work
- **Base Repository**: [RAFT: Recurrent All Pairs Field Transforms for Optical Flow](original-repo-link)
- **Paper**: Teed, Z. & Deng, J. (2020). RAFT: Recurrent All Pairs Field Transforms for Optical Flow. ECCV 2020.

## My Contributions
- Modified loss functions in `train.py` 
- Tested and compared loss functions
- Training results and analysed

## Changes Made
- **File modified**: `train.py`
